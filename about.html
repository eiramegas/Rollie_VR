								<h2 id="story">Our Story</a></h2>
								<div class="image right"><img src="Photos/2 - About Us/B - Our Story/NEW_ rollie-wooden-and-helmet.gif" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Rollie VR was born in the summer of 2019 in the Kohl&rsquo;s DesignIt! Lab at Discovery World with a group of six Design Futurist interns. Handed a set of Google cardboard glasses and given a broad prompt to make them even cheaper and related, one, to the exhibits within the museum and, two, to the wide set of majors within the intern cohort, the all-female intern group (women empowerment say what!!!) had a hefty but exciting challenge ahead of them. Bouncing ideas off one another and their dedicated and involved supervisor, Branden Aptiz, they eventually narrowed their sights on building their own virtual reality company that was targeted at created unique experiences to improve everyone&rsquo;s capacity for empathy. By focusing on developing a business as a whole rather than just a singular product, the team was able to involve each intern, optimizing each of their skills.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Olivia was able to extend her Biomedical Engineering senior design project at Marquette by drawing inspiration for Rollie VR&rsquo;s first project from her client, a young girl with Emanuel Syndrome and practicing her systems engineering skills of bringing each component of a project/business together as project manager. Alison grew her Interactive Media Arts studies through her development of educational virtual reality environment.&nbsp; A Math major, Sage improved her understanding and skills of the programming and code that goes behind building an intricate and impressive website. Amber used her expertise in Graphic Design to create an incredibly artistic and well developed identity package to market Rollie VR. Studying Product Design, Cheri used a past Kohl&rsquo;s DesignIt! Lab project and coupled it with the fundamental concepts of the Google cardboard glasses to create our fun and wearable VR helmet. And, finally, near first project&rsquo;s completion, Autumn used her savvy skills as a Marketing minor to develop a plan to market Rollie VR to the public.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>All in all, something that could have been a very simple and small project, turned into a large scale business with a core goal of creating a better world that values using technological advancements to foster empathy and unite us all through a common understanding of each other&rsquo;s story.</p>
