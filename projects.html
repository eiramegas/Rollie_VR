									<h1>Rollie VR Projects

									<p>Rollie VR consists of 2 parts, the cardboard headset that facilitates the VR experience, and the VR experience itself</p>

									<div id="headset" class="image right"><img src="Photos/3 - Our Projects/B - About the Headset/NEW_ helmet-diagram.gif"></div>
									<h3>About the Headset</h3>
									<p>Two of the largest limitations of traditional virtual reality technology are the size/setup and the incredible cost. At Rollie VR, we have adapted the Google Cardboard lenses into a wearable, fun, and fashionable helmet that costs even less and is easier and quicker to assemble. </p>
									<hr />
									<h3>About the VR Experience</h3>
									<p>
									As the goal of Rollie VR is aid in the development of empathy for those with various diseases and disorders, we have created a comprehensive, interactive and educational virtual tour for a number topics (click here for a list of projects or to suggest one!). Each environment includes a menu of rooms that explore the disease or disorder in a different way: 
									</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Science behind the disorder</li>
									<li>Case study documenting real-life experiences living with the disorder
									</li>
									<li>An example of an assistive technology for the difficulties that come with the disorder</li>
									<li>More about Rollie VR and its other applications</li></ul>
									<div class="image left"><img src="Photos/3 - Our Projects/C - About the VR Experience/NEW_ rollie-wood-outside.gif"></div>
									<p>You can immerse yourself into these different worlds just by loading the VR environment onto your smartphone using the Google Cardboard app and viewing it through our VR helmet!

								<h2>Emanuel Syndrome Project</h2>
								<p>Olivia's senior design project at Marquette was a communication device for an eight year old girl with Emanuel Syndrome, which is a chromosomal disorder that disrupts normal development and different parts of the body (<a href="https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/9835/emanuel-syndrome">More Info Here</a>). Our Project creates a virtual reality experience to <ol><li>Explain the scientific background of Emanuel Syndrome</li> <li> to make a realistic and interactive space to understand what it is like to experience the different symptoms of the syndrome.</li></ol> Then, a solution to one of the symptoms, inability to communicate, will be present to introduce the idea that biomedical engineers can develop solutions to everyday difficulties like the ones people with Emanuel Syndrome experience. 
									</p>
									<h3>Details of Emanuel Syndrome</h3>
									<p>Typically, people have 46 chromosomes: 2 pairs of each chromosome 1-22. Individuals with Emanuel Syndrome have one extra chromosome, a combination of chromosome 11 and 22, which is called derivative 22 or der(22) shown below. This extra chromosome causes the delay in intellectual development delay and body anomalies. 
										</p>
										<div class="image right"><img src="Photos/3 - Our Projects/D - Emanuel Syndrome Project/NEW_ olivia-and-anna.gif"></div>
									<p>The idea for this would be to go down the helix of the chromosomes and highlight 11 and 22. Then, the VR would show them melding together to become der(22). </p>
									<h4>Symptoms</h4>
									<p>
									<p>**The following are the symptoms I noticed the client for my senior design team experienced. Research shows that symptoms are very unique to each person. However, since I am familiar with the client symptoms and have the contact information for her parents explaining her symptoms is best.</p>
									<table class="tftable" border="1">
											<tr><th>Symptoms</th><th>VR Expierence</th></tr>
											<tr><td>Spastic (head & hands) </td><td>How it looks when your spastic (visual impairments) 
											Create a sort of shaking view
											</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Iris colomba (eye impairment) </td><td>A lense of the visual impairment 
											-at one point maybe couple this with a spastic head
											</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Lack of fine motor skills</td><td>Do an everyday task
											A hand reaching for something maybe and not doing what you want/expect it to
											</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Cannot speak, just makes noises</td><td>Trying to communicate but no one can understand</td></tr>
											</table>
